# Graph Partitioning

We come up with several algorithms for the Graph Partitioning Problem. The objective of the problem is to partition the vertex set $V$ into $k$ subsets of approximately equal size. 
The algorithms introduced are: Exhaustive Search, Integer Programming, Constraint Programming, Greedy Graph Growing, Local Search, Recursive Bisectioning, Spectral Clustering
